#### **Installation**

To make this project you need to do the following:

1. Pull the project down with git clone or fork the repository.
1. Install the dependencies with npm install.
1. Type node backend.js into your node window.
1. Visit localhost:3000 in your web browser to start the app.

You may also visit [my deployed site](https://stark-temple-19524.herokuapp.com/notes).

#### **Trials**
---
Learning how to tell express where the static files are, was a very powerful addition.

#### **Usage**
---
When the site is open, you will see a left menu bar with all the notes stored.  In the middle you will see a place to put a title and a note to be stored.  By clicking the disk icon in the top right you can save the note.  The title of the note will appear on the left hand side of the app to be retrieved later.
